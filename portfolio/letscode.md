## Summary

An _experimental_ teaching aide for interacting with students while teaching lectures on programming languages.
The site is no longer live.

This tool gave students a playground to try ideas during the lecture to explore variations of examples presented during class and allowed the presenter to give students to control of the shared text editor so they could live demo their question “Hey, what about this snippet of code”.

## Details

As a teacher of programming languages, I have struggled with the best way to teach a programming language in a lecture style course (yes we include hands on labs, but when actually discussing the syntax and semantics to a group of 60).  I built letscode.ca as a prototype system to where each student (with access to a laptop or phone during the lecture) could watch (live) various scenarios, but the professor could also allow others, in real-time, to provide their own insight.

The tool was used in 2017, and offered a shared IDE in the browser to experiment with Elixir, Java, C and PHP.  Online tools like Replit,
with much more funding than a side-project, usurped the capabilities of LetsCode
and the tool was decommissioned in 2020.
