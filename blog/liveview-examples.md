## Summary

[LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view)
for [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) on [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir) is definitely scratching an itch
in the world of rich client apps, without having to go full-on
client-side framework.  Here's a list of open
source projects, some with online demos and other where you can
(easily) run the code locally.

[LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view)
for [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) on [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir) is definitely scratching an itch
in the world of rich client apps, without having to go full-on
client-side framework.  Here's a list of open
source projects, some with online demos and other where you can
(easily) run the code locally.

Sometimes it's best to learn by examples, here goes.

| ![Ant Farm](liveview-examples/ant_farm.jpg) | A virtual ant farm where every ant was a GenServer process, simulating a basic AI behavior. Originally straightforward, it got much bigger and eventually forgotten. Finally gave the ant farm another go, this time using Elixir only. So I rolled up my sleeves, and surprisingly, four or five hours later I had the ant farm working, and this is how it was done... | [Concurrent ant farm with Elixir and Phoenix LiveView](http://codeloveandboards.com/blog/2019/03/28/concurrent-ant-farm-with-elixir-and-phoenix-liveview/), [Ant Farm Demo](https://phoenix-liveview-ant-farm.herokuapp.com/), [Ant Farm Source](https://github.com/bigardone/phoenix-liveview-ant-farm) |
| ![Erlang Observer](liveview-examples/observer.jpg) | A port of [observer_cli](https://github.com/zhongwencool/observer_cli) using [LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view). The docs are clear, accurate and provide a very smooth introduction to the capabilities of this interactive server-side rendering way of doing things. | [Observer Live](https://zorbash.com/post/observer-live/), [Erlang Observer Demo](https://liveview.zorbash.com/), [Erlang Observer Source](https://github.com/zorbash/observer_live) |
| ![Markdown Editor](liveview-examples/markdown.jpg) | When a client connects to the server they are initially served some HTML content. In our case, what is initially rendered is a textarea prepopulated with some Markdown and the HTML view of that Markdown. However, this is where things get interesting. A websocket connection is opened between the client and the server. The server listens for changes in the textbox, re-renders the HTML, and sends the smallest possible change back to the client which then updates the DOM. | [Markdown Editor Demo](http://markdown.dichev.io/), [Markdown Editor Source](https://github.com/nickdichev/markdown-live) |
| ![Flappy Bird](liveview-examples/flappy_bird.jpg) | Flappy Bird Clone written in LiveView.

| ![Hippo](liveview-examples/hippo.jpg) | Hippopotamuses have been the subjects of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos wanted to live in the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung so that it can be inspected for fish bones. | [Hippo Demo](https://elegant-monstrous-planthopper.gigalixirapp.com/), [Hippo Source](https://github.com/miladamilli/hippo_game_live/) |
| ![Bear Game](liveview-examples/bear.jpg) | A little toy repo to show off a very unnecessarily fast-rendering clock, done with Phoenix LiveView.
