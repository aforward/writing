I am getting back into [Chef](https://www.chef.io/), and the landscape
seems to have changed quite a bit in the last 10 years.  I am going
to documenting the journey in a series of bite sized articles.

[Official install docs](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html) are here.
So follow them, and read along.
