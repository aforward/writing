### June 7, 2014

An exploration of the Go language (golang) to build a simple webcrawler, all code is available on [Github](https://github.com/aforward/webl). This application was written as an exploration of the language and demonstration of the various features of the language; it is not feature complete but should be complex enough to provide some examples of using Go's various concurrent features, tied together in a simple command line and web interface.
