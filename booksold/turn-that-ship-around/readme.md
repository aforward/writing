![Turn the Ship Around](turn-that-ship-around.png)

From [Basecamp's handbook on what influenced them](https://basecamp.com/handbook/03-what-influenced-us). "Leadership should mean giving control rather than taking control and creating leaders rather than forging followers", David Marquet. Basecamp employs great people and they deserve the freedom and autonomy to act on their own. Don't wait for permission, just state what you're going to do, and then do it.
