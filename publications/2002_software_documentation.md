# The Relevance of Software Documentation, Tools and Technologies: A Survey
## DocEng - 2002

## Abstract

This paper highlights the results of a survey of software professionals. The survey was conducted in the spring of 2002. The results are compiled from 48 individuals in the software field ranging from junior developers to managers and project leaders. One of the goals of this survey was to uncover the perceived relevance (or lack thereof) of software documentation, and the tools and technologies used to maintain, verify and validate such documents. The survey results highlight the preferences for and aversions against software documentation tools. Participants agree that documentation tools should seek to better extract knowledge from core resources. These resources include the systemâ€™s source code, test code and changes to both. Resulting technologies could then help reduce the effort required for documentation mainte-nance, something that is shown to rarely occur. The data reports compelling evidence that software professionals value technolo-gies that improve automation of the documentation process, as well as facilitating its maintenance.
