# The Convergence of Modeling and Programming: Facilitating the Representation of Attributes and Associations in the Umple Model-Oriented Programming Language
## PhD Thesis - 2010

## Abstract

This thesis investigates approaches to model-driven development (MDD) in which developers can keep using their familiar textual programming languages, but with additional modeloriented concepts. The added concepts include associations and attributes as found in the Unified Modeling Language (UML), as well as concepts from software patterns and other common programming abstractions.
