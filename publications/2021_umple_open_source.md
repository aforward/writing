# Umple: Model-driven development for open source and education
## Science of Computer Programming (Journal) - 2021

## Abstract

Umple is an open-source software modeling tool and compiler. It incorporates textual language constructs for UML modeling, including associations and state machines. It includes traits, aspects, and mixins for separation of concerns. It supports embedding methods written in many object-oriented languages, enabling it to generate complete multilingual systems. It provides comprehensive analysis of models and generates many kinds of diagrams, some of which can be edited to update the Umple code. Umple runs on the command line, in a web browser or in integrated development environments. It is designed to help developers reduce code volume, while they develop in an agile, model-driven manner. Umple is also targeted at educational users where students are motivated by its ability to generate real systems from their software models.
