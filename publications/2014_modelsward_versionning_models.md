# A Novel Approach to Versioning and Merging Model and Code Uniformly
##  Modelsward - 2014

## Abstract

Model Driven Architecture (MDA) advocates the use of models, rather than code, as the main development artifact. Yet model versioning and merging tools still lag in capabilities, ease of use and adoption relative to source code versioning and merging tools. This forces many teams to avoid model-based collaboration and concurrent model modifications. In this paper, we highlight the main challenges behind the relatively small adoption of model merging approaches. We present a novel model-based programming technology that addresses many of those challenges. The approach treats code and models uniformly, effectively enabling modelers to version and merge models using existing text-based technologies.
