# Specifying Trace Directives for UML Attributes and State Machines
##  Modelsward - 2014

## Abstract

Developers using model driven development (MDD) to develop systems lack the ability to specify traces at the model level. This results in specification of traces at the generated code level. In this paper, we are proposing trace directives that operate the model level to specify the tracing of UML attributes and state machines. Trace directives are implemented as a part of the Umple textual modeling language, thus these directives can be expressed in a textual form. Trace code will be injected into system source code that corresponds to trace directives specified at the model level.
