# Challenges and Opportunities in Applying Research Prototypes and Findings into Industrial Practice
## CASCON - 2010

## Abstract

Software Engineering has always been a fast moving and changing industry. This has continually presented an additional challenge for the Software Engineering research community; namely, how to catch up with fast changing technologies, tools, and practices? How to bring on-board yet another tool, methodology, or results to influence an industry that is driven by a variety of business objectives and regulations? How to make sure that current research efforts are aligned with cutting edge technologies and practices? Why is it that many of the technical advancements that we have seen in the software engineering and computer science come from the industry, rather than academia as it is the case in other disciplines?
