# A Taxonomy of Software Types to Facilitate Search and Evidence-Based Software Engineering
## Cascon - 2008

## Abstract

Empirical software research could be improved if there was a systematic way to identify the types of software for which empirical evidence applies. This is because results are unlikely to be globally applicable, but are more likely to apply only in certain contexts such as the type of software on which the evidence has been tested. We present a software taxonomy that should help researchers to apply their research systematically to particular types of software. The taxonomy was generated using existing partial taxonomies and input from survey participants. If a taxonomy such as ours gains acceptance, it will facilitate comparison and appropriate application of research. In the paper, we present the benefits of such a taxonomy, the process we used to develop it, and the taxonomy itself.
