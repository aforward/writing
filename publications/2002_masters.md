# Software Documentation – Building and Maintaining Artefacts of Communication
## Master’s Thesis - 2002

## Abstract

Software documentation is an important aspect of both software projects and software engineering in general. In fact, documentation engineering has become a popular sub-domain in the software engineering community. Unfortunately, the current perception of documentation is that it is outdated, irrelevant and incomplete. For the most part, this perception is probably true. Regrettably, the documentation concern cannot be resolved by simply mandating more and better documentation. This approach fails to resolve the problem as the solution ignores the fundamental goals of software engineering. The role of documentation in a software engineering environment is to communicate information to its audience and instil knowledge of the system it describes. Documentation should efficiently allow for future software development without hindering current progress. Our research focuses on the issue of documentation quality. In particular, which attributes of documentation make it effective to the audience and how can this information be monitored and parameterized to provide a better perspective about the relevance of documentation in a software project.
