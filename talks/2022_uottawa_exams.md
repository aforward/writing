# Offering each student an individualized exam
## UOttawa Awards - 2020

## Pitch

Proctoring exams in an online world is complicated.  One very real problem is how to limit a student's ability to collaborate on what should be an individual effort (in other words, mitigate cheating).  In this thought piece, we will look at what it might take to make this a reality.

## Summary

A thought experiment about student evaluations given to the [faculty of engineering](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/)
as part of the 2020 awards ceremonies where I explored how could we offer each student a unique exam.
The question can be naively answered with... we write a unique exam for each student.  To clarify,
how could we do this feasibly.  What would the process look like, what are the constraints, assumptions
and pre-conditions for such an offering to be practically feasible.
