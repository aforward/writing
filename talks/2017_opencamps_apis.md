# Oh, the API Clients You'll Build (in Elixir)
## Open Camps NY - 2017

## Pitch

Congratulations!

Today is your day.

You’re off to Build API Clients!

You’re off and away!

You have Elixir in your head.

You have GenServer, GenStage, and Streams to use.

You can pipe (|>) your functions

as many times as you choose.


## Summary

Using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) it can be quite rare (this was back in 2017, but still somewhat true today)
to find officially supported clients for your favourite APIs.

In this [talk at Open Camps in 2017](https://opencamps.org/2017/about) we will look at how you
can build your own. The exercise of writing your own has many benefits.

* First, you learn a bit more about Elixir, the language, and how to leverage a bunch of it features.
* Second, you learn a bit more about the API you are working with.
* And finally, you gain some insight into how it could be built so that you can better evaluate the altneratives.
