# Power of Zero
## ElixirConf USA - 2017

## Pitch

Automate. Automate. Automate.

Come learn how to leverage Digital Ocean API, Erlang's
hot code swapping, and CI tools to build an automated
pipeline so that you can focus on writing code; not
deploying it.


## Summary

Automation is hard, but the benefits can be phenomenal. This
can be especially challenging when working on your [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) side
project, as you want to see results quickly, so maybe a
zero-click deploy and continuous delivery are not on your mind.

In this talk at [ElixirConf USA 2017](https://elixirconf.com/2017/speakers/#andrew_forward),
I will help show you that even on a budget, even
on a team of one you can streamline your software development
to achieve some lofty goals including

* Immutable infrastructure
* Zero Downtime deploys
* Automatic (aka Zero-Click) Builds (Continuous Integration)
* Automatic (aka Zero-Click) Deploys (Continuous Delivery)
