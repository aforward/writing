# The Forever Developer
## U Waterloo CS446 - 2018

## Pitch

Some people never stop loving to code.

If this might be you, then it’s not enough to simply continue to “code”, as you risk becoming obsolete despite your many years experience.


## Summary

In this talk given to [4th year SE students at uwaterloo](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs446/1171/)
we will look in the abstract at building your career as a forever developer, with anecdotes following my own path over the last 20 years.
But don’t worry, there will also be some very concrete examples, and technology predictions as there are great benefits to attaching yourself
early to right bandwagons in tech.
