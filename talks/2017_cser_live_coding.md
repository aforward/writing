# Using (Controlled) Live Coding To Interactively Teach Programming Language Concepts
## CSER - 2017

## Pitch

Normally, live code editors provide an ability to keep remote clients in sync
between all users.  Rather than simply mimic this automatic syncing of code, each
student (audience member) will receive their own  working environment
(in the cloud - so nothing but a browser required) and code can be selectively synced, pushed,
pulled between individuals students and/or the teacher.

This allows your audience to individually try things out in real-time, and the teacher to
control the direction of the lesson.  It keeps the students engaged and allows for better
interactions as students can now "ask questions" and "demonstrate alternatives" through code.

## Summary

In this talk given at the [2017 Consortium for Software Engineering Research](https://www.cser.ca)
we will demonstrate an interactive teaching technique to get
students more involved when teaching programming language concepts.  The approach
will build on "live" code editors that are typically used for remote paired
programming (or remote interview coding) and apply it to the classroom.

The talk will dog-food itself a bit, as I will run through some of the
technical concepts used in the implementation by sharing code samples
with the environment itself, and anyone with a laptop could join in.
