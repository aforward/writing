From [Basecamp's handbook on what influenced them](https://basecamp.com/handbook/03-what-influenced-us). [Basecamp doesn't] strive for trophies, swoon for trinkets, gameify our apps with badges, or push any other form of extrinsic motivation for neither ourselves nor our customers. Working at Basecamp and work with Basecamp should be about the intrinsic motivation of doing a good job, not because youâ€™re trying to impress someone else.
