![Surrounded by Idiots: The Four Types of Human Behavior and How to Effectively Communicate with Each in Business (and in Life)](covers/surrounded-by-idiots.png)

Author Thomas Erikson explains that there are four key behavior types that define
how we interact with and perceive the people around us. Understanding someone's
pattern of behavior is the key to successful communication.
Erikson breaks down the four kinds of behavior types—Reds who are dominant and
commanding, Yellows who are social and optimistic, Greens who are laid back and
friendly, and Blues who are analytical and precise—and explains how to identify
and interact with each type of person. Instead of being bogged down with overly
 technical categorizations, the simple four color system allows you to speedily
 identify a friend or coworker and adjust how you speak and share with them.
